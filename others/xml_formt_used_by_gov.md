## Why do most governments in Europe use XML format to transfer data?

- Governments optimize for law, compliance, and stability, not developer ergonomics.

- XML is simply better at legally-binding, strongly validated, long-lived, cross-vendor communication.

- Migration would be absurdly expensive with almost no political reward.
